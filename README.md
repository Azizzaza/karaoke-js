# Karaoke JS
A simple JavaScript-powered karaoke script. The script takes in a multi-dimensional array of lyrics
with specific timings for each word to be highlighted binded to a designated audio player element.

# Dependencies
The script uses the <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> framework.
The app uses the following:
* <a href="http://slim-lang.com/">Slim</a> (HTML)
* <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> (CSS)
* <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> (JavaScript)

# Setup
To build off the app using the current framework, one would need to know how to use Middleman to do so.
It should be as easy as installing the framework using <code>gem install middleman</code> onto one's system and running
<code>middleman build</code>. More information can be found on the <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">framework's website</a>.
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it would be perfectly fine to just edit the files in the /build directory in this repository to do simple tasks
such as changing the audio player element to point to a specific track and adding the lyrics to the JavaScript.
